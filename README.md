Entry for Mini Ludum Dare #44 compo : 7dRTS.

You have an army or robots, but they are kind of dumb, they only understand simple orders.

You don't have to control your units, only to give orders at waypoints and to chose what to build.

Click on :
* waypoints to set orders for your robots ;
* arrows on building to select which robot you want to build (when available).

Keyboard arrows move the view/camera.
Escape to abandon the stage.

Yes, it's heavily inspired by Z, from The Bitmap Brothers (1996).

## Going technical

* Haxe
